# 📊 HR Analytics – Employee Promotion Prediction

This project analyzes HR employee data to understand the key factors influencing promotions and builds a machine learning model to predict whether an employee is eligible for promotion.  
The work is implemented entirely in a **Jupyter Notebook**, covering data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

This notebook will later evolve into a full web application.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Identify factors that contribute to employee promotions  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Apply exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Build and evaluate a classification model  
- Generate insights for HR decision-making

## 📁 Notebook Contents

The notebook includes:

- Dataset loading & initial inspection  
- Missing value analysis and handling  
- Outlier treatment  
- Categorical encoding  
- Feature scaling  
- EDA (value counts, distributions, correlations)  
- Model training (classification model)  
- Confusion matrix, accuracy, and classification report  
- Final predictions
