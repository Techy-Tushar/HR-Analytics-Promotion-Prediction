# 📊 HR Analytics – Employee Promotion Prediction

This project analyzes HR employee data to identify key factors influencing promotions and builds **multiple machine learning classification models** to predict whether an employee is eligible for promotion.

The entire workflow is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook**, covering data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model comparison, and evaluation.

This project is designed as a **strong ML foundation** and will later be extended into a **Streamlit web application**.

### ✔ 4. Model Building & Evaluation

Multiple classification models were trained and evaluated, including:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- XGBoost  

Each model was evaluated using:
- **Accuracy Score**  
- **Confusion Matrix**  
- **Classification Report**  

Model performance was compared to understand strengths and limitations.
